Introduction:

A Development Environment  

This is a development environment that helps to build multi-platorm
code. It uses a number of conventions to support building against
mutliple platforms.
The primary convention is to use different "src & include" files to
manage platform specific libraries and code and the relie on compiler
flags to ensure the right version are picked.
In C / C++ code this avoids using Macros to managed platform variations

The environment is invoked by going into new shell instance, which then
picks up all the environment variables required to build code

The target build enviornments was orginally C / C++ with additional make files
to support various special processers such as embedded SQL, Corba etc

The various Makefile includes for differnt target types should prove to have
ongoing use to people do need to use Make,

I have uplaoded this to allow me to use these, rather than re-read the GNU Make
file documentation again after all these years.

So this set of files encodes a number of conventions by providing scripts and
make files to help build your project.
